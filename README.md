The application gets the images of the cats from the Cat API. When the Load More button is clicked, there are more images that are loaded. I have created a Like button for every image, and when the user clicks on it, it will display the 3 most liked images at the bottom of the page with the number of likes. Also, as this is an external API, I have used a fake POST request which shows how the POST works, without actually posting the images to the API.
